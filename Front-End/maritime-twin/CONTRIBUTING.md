## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Development Guidelines

### 1. Domain First
When adding business logic (e.g., fuel consumption, pirate zones), implement it in `src/domain` first as a pure TypeScript class or function.
- **Do not** put complex logic in React components.
- **Do not** couple domain logic with Mapbox specific objects if possible.

### 2. State Management
- Use `useAppStore` for global state.
- For local UI state (e.g., is a dropdown open?), use `useState` in the component.

### 3. Map Layers
- Encapsulate map layers in custom hooks (e.g., `useWeatherLayer`).
- This keeps `MapView.tsx` clean and declarative.
- Hooks should handle their own cleanup (removing layers/sources) on unmount.

### 4. Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS for all styling.
- Follow the existing color palette (Slate for UI, specialized colors for Map features).

## Project Structure
Refer to `ARCHITECTURE.md` for a detailed breakdown of the codebase organization.

## Data
The graph data is located in `public/data/graph.json`. This is generated by the Python backend pipelines.
If you change the backend data structure, ensure `src/domain/types.ts` is updated to match.
